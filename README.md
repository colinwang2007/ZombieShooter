# ZombieShooter

(This game is still a work in progress).

This project is a simple two dimension, first person shooting game in progress. It is played using the WASD keys and space bar to shoot. The game in general seems more advanced and interactive than the other two (pong and timber), and my goal is to complete this game with more features aswell.

I started this game while learning about SFML, and I strive to finish it in my free time. This serves to continue helping me understand the logistics and code within the game. In order to play the game, download the media file and change the pathBase variable to the path of the folder, aswell as setting up SFML with your corresponding IDE.
